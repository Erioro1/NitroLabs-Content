A Space Where Idea Meet Opportunities Just Launched in LAUTECH

After years of lack of quality access to relevance and insight, the launch of one of the most highly-sought after Co-working space and Innovation Hub in the community, NitroLabs was finally registered in the heart of the populace.

As described by those who witnessed the launch of the CO-Working space and Innovation Hub on Monday, December 16, 2019, they were of the strong opinion that the community is blessed with such establishment at a crucial time like this.

According to the Director of the newly established innovative ambience, Mr David Olateru, he said that the idea of the space was borne out of the urgent need to transform the Lautech community as a whole through providing a comfortable environment for those that are smartpreneurs and have disruptive solutions.

In addendum, he highlighted that few of the problem-solvers we have in the community battles with unfavourable economic harsh conditions such as epileptic power supply, unpleasant data plan subscription, and most importantly, the opportunity to share one’s idea with like minds. He further stressed that despite the school being known as a technological space, it’s the students, stakeholders who have a larger role to play as regards the development of the community. And this is why a platform like NitroLabs is coming out.

Some of the other services Nitrolabs provides are Talent Acceleration, Technical Services for SMEs, Training and Startup Incubation.
