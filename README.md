"A Space Where Idea Meet Opportunities Just Launched in LAUTECH:"

After years of lack of quality access to relevance and insight, the launch of one of the most highly-sought after Co-working space and Innovation Hub in the community, NitroLabs was finally registered in the heart of the populace.

As described by those who witnessed the launch of the CO-Working space and Innovation Hub on Monday, December 16, 2019, they were of the strong opinion that the community is blessed with such establishment at a crucial time like this.

According to the Director of the newly established innovative ambience, Mr David Olateru, he said that the idea of the space was borne out of the urgent need to transform the Lautech community as a whole through providing a comfortable environment for those that are smartpreneurs and have disruptive solutions.

In addendum, he highlighted that few of the problem-solvers we have in the community battles with unfavourable economic harsh conditions such as epileptic power supply, unpleasant data plan subscription, and most importantly, the opportunity to share one’s idea with like minds. He further stressed that despite the school being known as a technological space, it’s the students, stakeholders who have a larger role to play as regards the development of the community. And this is why a platform like NitroLabs is coming out.

Some of the other services Nitrolabs provides are Talent Acceleration, Technical Services for SMEs, Training and Startup Incubation.

Most business owners we know today are guilty of this charge; it is deadly. If you should ask some of them the reason they dived into business in the first place, you will start hearing things like: “Because others are into it,” or even “I just want to make money.”

                                    “Positioning Yourself for Opportunities in 2020:A Five-Tools Guide:”
                                  
The whole world is busy, there has never been room for slothfulness. Even most of the Start-ups and their so-called brothers, Multinational organizations continue in their rigorous pursuits of seeking the best of the best as regards working with them in terms of job employment. Please, don’t blame them or cast unnecessary aspersions. 
However, it would interest you to know that despite the current holocaust (mediocrity menace) bedevilling the world, most especially, the African continent, the chosen ones still sufficed. 
We both know that it is not as if they got some special powers or an in-built fortune, they are just good at what they do. You don’t need to have attained a 100% level of perfection before you could be able to join the few list of the identified CHOSEN ONES. Are you God? 
All that is being expected of you has to do with how you could position yourself for some of the opportunities that lie ahead; can you train your eyes to see opportunities? Note, your background is not a factor here.
In this article, you will discover some of the vital reasons why you should start using our Co-Working space:
 
1. You Must Know That Anything is Possible on Planet Earth.

Who would have thought about the emergence of the dot-com generation?
Having studied the past three ages (Stone, Agrarian, Industrial) carefully, one would realize that their effects could not be compared to what the world enjoys now. Literally, the best time to be alive is now.
With the breakthroughs of Conglomerates like Google, Yahoo, Facebook, the rate at which information is available right within our finger-tips is overwhelming. 
What this implies is we not only need information but quality ones that would enable us to stay relevant. 
Statistically, an average youth spends over 6-hours daily on their mobile phones and are still not productive. Ask yourself this, “what kind of information am I consuming?”
Until we learn how to filter information that comes our way, the languish still remains.

2. Be a Student of Literature.

An adage which says that “if you want to be a leader, get ready to be a reader” is still potent. 
Virtually, most people go around about all sorts of engagements but still, complain bitterly because of their continuous futile results. Opportunities are just like skills; you cannot offer what you don’t possess.
To gain more insights, you must leaf through the pages of books, as this is the foundation that builds a man. And before a blink of an eye, the kind of mind needed for that opportunity would have been developed and well-nourished in the place of literature.
The more we read, the more we understand unlimited resources around us. Also, when we read books, we get to be acquainted with some instances beyond our current level of capacity.

3. Build Your Pool of Network.

“Show me your friend and I will tell you the kind of individual you are.” 
Seeing others securing all forms of opportunities is never magic. Enough of all those irrelevant friends that you have been moving with without any tangible proofs to show for it. If you really want to begin laying hands on some opportunities, you must start paying attention to your contact list, and this is known as the Law of Association.
“Likes attract likes.” Most of what is killing some dreams today is not having the slightest knowledge or clue of how to differentiate between their acquaintances from career builders/helpers.
This is just a simple principle of nature playing out here.

4. Maximize the Power of Your Social Platforms.

What are you using your social media accounts for? 
This is another powerful weapon that you can wield when it comes to getting opportunities. In case you don’t know, there is always someone who knows another person, lurking around for potentials online. 
Some people are guilty of posting irrelevant junks, such as when they are in a club smoking, gossiping about other people’s affairs, and few to mention via their social platforms, which is not good for any personal brand presence.
Your accounts should be meant for developing capacity.

5. Have a Mentor.

While trying to become a global relevant citizen via different applications, it is very germane to have someone that could guide you. 
One major fact that distinguishes mentors is their years of experience and expertise. Remember, they have been there before, which makes them the best possible shot. 
There are some opportunities that warrants their input, especially the ones that have to involve Fellowships, Grants, etc.
